Given a monotonic function f(x,y) and a number z, find all pairs [x, y] such that f(x, y) = z.
f(x, y) = x + y + xy 
x, y in [-1000, 1000], z = 1024

Develop your program in Python 3 or C++. You need to submit either a single .py or .cpp file. No config, archive, library, or executable files will be accepted.

Grading scheme: 

any complete solution with runtime complexity X+Y -> 3pts
incomplete or wrong solutions with some effort, or runtime complexity higher than X+Y -> 1pt
brute force, hardcoded, non-submitted attempts or wrong/incomplete solutions without effort -> 0pts
